Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Cookie import/export** (`persona/cookies.py`): move a logged-in session
  between machines or seed a fresh profile with one you already have. Reads
  Cookie-Editor / EditThisCookie JSON, Playwright storage state and Netscape
  `cookies.txt`; writes JSON or `cookies.txt`. Available as
  `persona cookies list|export|import`, `GET`/`POST /api/profiles/{id}/cookies`,
  and Import/Export buttons in the dashboard's **Advanced** tab.
- **One-click Windows launcher** (`start.bat`): double-click to install deps on
  first run, pick the default engine (CloakBrowser first), then start the engine
  API + dashboard and open the browser.
- **Persisted default engine** for new profiles (`config.json`): `persona
  default-engine [name]` command, `GET`/`PUT /api/config` endpoints, and the
  dashboard defaulting new profiles to it. CloakBrowser is the top-priority
  default, and the last engine you pick "wins" (becomes the next default).
- **HTTP API** (`persona serve`, `engine/persona/server.py`) wrapping the store,
  validator and launcher so the dashboard can manage and launch profiles for real.
- **`python -m persona`** entry point (`persona/__main__.py`).
- Dashboard **live/demo mode**: connects to the engine API when available
  (launching opens a real browser), falls back to sample data when it isn't.
- **Pluggable launch engines** (`persona/drivers.py`): choose a stealth backend
  per profile — `playwright` (built-in), `patchright`, `camoufox`, or `cloak`
  (CloakBrowser). New `persona engines` command, `--engine` flag, `Profile.engine`
  field, dashboard engine selector, and `GET /api/engines` endpoint.
- **Dashboard redesign**: new "ink violet" theme, Space Grotesk / Inter / JetBrains
  Mono typography, motion (load reveals, status pulses, drawer slide), and a
  dedicated **Engines** page recommending CloakBrowser & Camoufox with one-click
  install commands. Reduced-motion respected.

### Changed
- **Hardened the stealth script**: `navigator.webdriver` now reads `false` from the
  prototype (not an own property), `window.chrome`, realistic `navigator.plugins`/
  `mimeTypes` (native `PluginArray`), consistent `permissions.query`, and native
  `toString()` on all patched functions — passing BrowserScan's basic checks.
- `launcher.py` is now a thin dispatcher over `drivers.py`.

### Fixed
- **Startup URLs are now opened** on launch (first in the main tab, the rest in
  new tabs) instead of always landing on `about:blank`.
- **Launch button no longer sticks on "running"** after you close the browser
  yourself — the dashboard polls run status in live mode and flips back to start.
- **"Last active" now updates** (server records when a session ends and shows a
  relative time) instead of always reading "never".
- **New profiles no longer overwrite an existing one** — the server assigns each
  profile a unique id, and the local id generator is collision-resistant.
- Suppressed Chromium's infobars: the "controlled by automated test software"
  bar (Playwright) and the cosmetic "--no-sandbox unsupported flag" bar
  (CloakBrowser, via `--test-type` — invisible to websites).
- `persona launch --headless` no longer hangs forever waiting for a window that
  never opens.

## [0.1.0] - 2025

### Added
- **Engine**: coherent fingerprint generator (device-archetype approach) with
  `validate()`; `Fingerprint`/`Proxy`/`Profile` models; JSON-per-profile store
  with import/export and persistent user-data dirs; stealth init-script
  generator; Playwright launcher with proxy support; full CLI.
- **Dashboard**: React web console with profile grid, tabbed fingerprint editor,
  live coherence meter, proxy manager, bulk create, folders, tags, search.
- Monorepo layout, CI, docs, and contribution guides.
